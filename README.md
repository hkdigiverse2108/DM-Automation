**Oh Daddy** is a minimal, self-hosted, ManyChat-style tool for Instagram and Facebook comment automations. Someone comments a keyword on your post, they get a public reply right away plus a DM straight to their inbox. No human involved.

No AI, no chatbot builder, no 40 platforms you'll never touch. Just keyword in, reply + DM out.

## ✨ What it does

### Keyword automations

Someone comments a keyword under your post, they get a public reply (rotated so it's not the same line every time) and a private DM via Meta's Private Replies API.

### Per-contact cooldown

Same person comments the same keyword twice in 24 hours? They only get replied to once. No spam, no annoyed followers.

### Per-post targeting

Scope an automation to one specific post, or leave it open to every post on the account.

### Four pages, nothing else

**Dashboard** (stats), **Automations** (keyword rules), **Accounts** (connect Meta via OAuth), **Settings** (credentials + webhook config).

### Built to not double-post

Every send claims its row in Postgres before it touches the Meta API. Webhook retries and Inngest retries can't send the same reply twice.

### Global send cap

All sends across every connected account share one hard cap of 195 comments/hour, just under Meta's Graph API ceiling. Doesn't matter if you've got 1 account or 5, the whole deploy can never trip Meta's rate limit. Overflow gets queued and delayed, never dropped.

### Secrets encrypted at rest

Access tokens and DB-stored settings are AES-256-GCM encrypted. A leaked backup or a raw SQL dump never hands over a live Meta token.

## 🆚 Oh Daddy vs ManyChat

| | **Oh Daddy** | **ManyChat** |
|---|---|---|
| Cost | ~$5/month total, your own hosting | Starts at $29/month, **per account** |
| Accounts | Add as many as you want (recommend keeping it to 4-5) | Pay-per-account, adds up fast |
| Hosting | Self-hosted, you own the server and the data | Their cloud, your data lives on their servers |
| Source | Open source (AGPL-3.0), read every line | Closed source |
| Scope | Instagram + Facebook comments, on purpose | Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS, AI chatbots, and more |
| Vendor lock-in | None, it's just Postgres + Next.js | Yes |

If you need the full chatbot suite, ManyChat is a solid product. If all you need is "keyword comment → reply + DM" for a handful of accounts, this is a lot cheaper and it's yours.

## ☁️ Deploy (Railway)

1. Fork this repo.
2. Open it in Claude Code / GG Coder.
3. Run `/setup-railway`.

That's it. It provisions Postgres, secrets, a self-hosted Inngest server, and deploys the app for you. It prints your dashboard login password (`ADMIN_PASSWORD`) once at the end, save it. Meta/Instagram credentials get entered afterward in the deployed app's `/setup` wizard.

**You need:** a Railway account ([create one here](https://railway.com?referralCode=Q2XTYD)), and the Railway CLI installed and logged in (`railway login`).
