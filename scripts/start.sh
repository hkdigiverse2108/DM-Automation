# Backgrounds a one-shot Inngest re-sync (scripts/post-deploy-sync.mjs): it
# waits for THIS new container to start serving locally, then PUTs the public
# NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL/api/inngest so the self-hosted Inngest engine picks up
# function changes (added/removed/retuned functions) with a publicly reachable
# SDK callback URL. Without this, self-hosted Inngest keeps the previous deploy's
# registration and new functions silently never run. The sync never blocks or
# fails startup.
#
# `exec`s the real server last so it owns PID 1 (clean SIGTERM handling for
# Railway's zero-downtime shutdown).
